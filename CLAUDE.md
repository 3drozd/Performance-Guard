# Claude Code Guidelines

## Rules

1. **Think first, read code** - Before making changes, read the relevant files in the codebase to understand the context.

2. **Check in before major changes** - Before making any significant changes, present the plan and wait for user verification.

3. **High-level explanations** - After each change, provide a brief high-level summary of what was modified.

4. **Keep it simple** - Every change should be as simple as possible. Avoid massive or complex changes. Each modification should impact as little code as possible. Simplicity is key.

5. **Maintain documentation** - Keep the ARCHITECTURE.md file updated to describe how the app works.

6. **No speculation** - Never speculate about code without reading it first. If a file is referenced, read it before answering. Give grounded, hallucination-free answers.
